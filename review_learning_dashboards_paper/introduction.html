<p>Online learning applications with a large proportion of interactive, self-chosen content for individual learning paths become more and more essential in higher education. Especially, the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced a boom in the usage of such online learning applications and empirical studies of their effectiveness.</p>
<p>In their meta analysis of more than 50 publications with randomized or quasi-randomized experiments on online, blended, and face-to-face learning <span class="citation">Means et al. (2010)</span> report significant improvement in learning outcomes for online and blended formats. Some more recent meta studies report superiority of flipped classroom approach compared to traditional learning.</p>
<p>A natural approach to designing active learning units in asynchronous online and blended settings is the flipped classroom technique which outperforms the classical lecturing approach in numerous studies (<span class="citation">Ying and Thompson (2020)</span> and <span class="citation">Shi et al. (2019)</span>). <span class="citation">Hew et al. (2020)</span> propose designing fully online flipped classroom wit online meeting instead of face-to-face one. Recent literature on MOOCs and small online courses (cite) underpin that even fully asynchronous online learning can be effective provided the course activities and materials are designed to meet students needs.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present paper is to review the recent advances and best practices for designing online learning units. Our primary goal is to identify effective parts and elements of online learning units essential for learning success and formulate recommendations for developing a such asynchronous online learning applications.</p>
<p>According to the taxonomy of <span class="citation">Cooper (1988)</span>, our main focus rests on research outcomes. That is, we are interested primarily in identification of the features of computer aided online learning environments that provably improve learning performance and experience. Best practices of using those features are also of major interest in our analysis. Finally, since generalization of the findings to other teaching domains is favorable, we also overview the underlying behavioral theories where possible.</p>
<p>Our perspective is a neutral semi-automatic filtration and representation of available published literature according to our specific criteria provided below.</p>
<p>To pivot/structure our analysis, we adopt a 5E instructional framework, where designing of learning units follows the five-phase learning cycle: Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate described in <span class="citation">Bybee et al. (2006)</span> and <span class="citation">Hew et al. (2020)</span>. The first phase aims at engaging students e.g. by pointing out to real world problem or question, the second phase deals with the exploration of the problem, the next step attempts at explaining the phenomena based on existing knowledge, elaborating the content implies providing material for deeper understanding and exercising, and the last step evaluates learning success. <span class="citation">Su, Chiu, and Wang (2010)</span> use 5E learning cycle for designing an e-learning course and show that they enhance learning success.</p>
<p>Since modern e-learning systems incorporate adaptation or personalizing feature, we propose to extend the 5E model to 5E+E by adding the “6 Evolution”-step. This step does not concern the learning cycle itself but rather includes the analysis of learning system usability and improvement considerations towards developing an adaptive personalized e-learning system, which adapts to individual learning preferences.
In the following, we undertake a more detailed overview of the learning cycle phases.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Engagement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Various definitions of student engagement exist. For instance, <span class="citation">Hu, Kuh, and Li (2008)</span> understand engagement as “the amount of effort dedicated to educational activities that bring out ideal performance”. <span class="citation">A. Lewis et al. (2010)</span> see engagement as “the extent to which learners’ thoughts, feelings, and activities are actively involved in learning”.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Wong and Liem (2022)</span> define learning engagement as “students’ psychological state of activity that affords them to feel activated, exert effort, and be absorbed during learning activities”. Based on known theories about the concept, they differentiate between behavioral, cognitive and emotional components in engagement assessment. The authors view learning engagement as a multilevel construct varying with learning context and time. In this sense, engagement is superordinate to the other stages as it nurtures carrying out the learning activities.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Lee, Song, and Hong (2019)</span> identify the following aspects as indicators of engagement: 1) behavioral - learning effort (self completed units, invested time), participation in class activities (attendance, asking questions), interaction (between learner and instructor), 2) cognitive task - solving (knowledge formation, application, reflection/believes about achievement, focus), learning management (self-direction, schedule), 3) emotional - learning satisfaction (interest, expectations, enjoyment), sense of belonging (degree of connection in the learning community), learning passion (willingness to confront challenges in the learning process).</p>
<p><span class="citation">Skilling, Bobis, and Martin (2020)</span> measures seven adaptive factors as self-efficacy, mastery orientation, valuing, persistence, planning, task management, and enjoyment and the five maladaptive factor variables as anxiety, failure avoidance, uncertain control, self-handicapping and disengagement to connect engagement, motivation and achievement in particular towards secondary school mathematics.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Maroco et al. (2016)</span> develop a questionnaire in order to address university students engagement. <span class="citation">Assunção et al. (2020)</span> test the questionnaire and confirm that it can produce reliable and valid data on academic engagement of university students. <span class="citation">Tomás et al. (2022)</span> assess reliability and validity of further two self-assessment tools for quantifying engagement.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Exploration.</li>
</ol>
<p>The exploration phase is exemplified in <span class="citation">Bybee et al. (2006)</span> through experimental activities, preliminary investigation or using prior knowledge to generate new outcomes. Student activities encompass e.g. stating and testing predictions and hypotheses, trying alternatives and generating new ideas. Depending on the subject, such activities can be implemented online through interactive applications with manipulatives (e.g. varying input parameters producing another output), simulations, and scenario-based exploration. These “hands-on” experience has been shown to enhance learning success in the literature, see <span class="citation">Meylani, Bitter, and Legacy (2015)</span>. It is also connected to experiential learning (see <span class="citation">Morris (2020)</span>), where concrete experience is at core of the learning process.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Explanation.</li>
</ol>
<p>As <span class="citation">Bybee et al. (2006)</span>, this stage consists of providing new concepts or skills which serve as theoretical basis for solving the stated problem or explaining observed phenomena. In a purely online setting, where the instructor can not adapt to learning preferences of the learners, different learning preferences should be taken into account. <span class="citation">Meylani, Bitter, and Legacy (2015)</span> reviews works, where adding additional media contributed to learning success. Learners should have a palette of materials to acquire understanding of new concepts (as diagrams, videos, text-based materials) as <span class="citation">Katsaris and Vidakis (2021)</span>. Cite more learning styles in e-learning.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Elaboration</li>
</ol>
<p>As <span class="citation">Bybee et al. (2006)</span>, elaboration enhances deeper and broader understanding and application of new skills. We interpret this stage also as the possibility for students to intensively exercise and gain routinized skills in solving problems associated with new concepts. Also, in asynchronous online learning, where direct instructor feedback is not available, a self-testing possibility with direct feedback should be provided as <span class="citation">Meylani, Bitter, and Legacy (2015)</span>. To engage students more in exercising new concepts and attaining routinized skills, gamified learning actovities can be used. As noted in <span class="citation">Demmese, Yuan, and Dicheva (n.d.)</span>, such gamified activities can aid routine practice motivating to solve more exercises.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evaluation</li>
</ol>
<p>In this phase, ability assessment and the evaluation of student progress takes place. In online format, individual ability assessment is realized through quizzes with an end score. <span class="citation">Meylani, Bitter, and Legacy (2015)</span> points out the importance of self-monitoring in an online framework. An overview of completed activities and attained test scores can be implemented in form of learning analytics dashboard, which have been shown to enable learners to making informed decisions (<span class="citation">Susnjak, Ramaswami, and Mathrani (2022)</span>).</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evolution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evolve stage includes improving e-learning environment based on direct feedback, questionnaire (as e.g. system usability scale, <span class="citation">J. R. Lewis (2018)</span>) and learning analytics and adding personalized features. <span class="citation">Meylani, Bitter, and Legacy (2015)</span> stresses the importance of providing a form of learner control over the available online resources. Based on previous learning paths, an individual recommendation for each learner might nehance learning success. As noted in <span class="citation">Katsaris and Vidakis (2021)</span> personalized e-learning environments adapting to individual learning preferences are at rise. They have the potential to support individual learning process optimally. For instance, <span class="citation">Fatahi (2019)</span> propose adaptation of e-learning environments based on emotion and personality. <span class="citation">Khamparia and Pandey (2020)</span> review the methodologies, how e-learning adaptation is realized based on automatic assessment of learning styles and point out an overall utility for learners success.</p>
<p>Our coverage strategy is representative sample of papers available through the OpenAlex API which indexes 209M works collected from various sources as Crossref, PubMed and institutional and preprint repositories as arXiv providing all together 124,000 publishing venues as <span class="citation">Priem, Piwowar, and Orr (2022)</span>.</p>
<p>For our analysis, we select articles published in the period from 2019-01-01 to 2023-03-31. The time frame was chosen so as to tie on the comprehensive review in <span class="citation">Martin, Sun, and Westine (2020)</span> covering works from 2009-2018 and the identified twelve online learning research themes, to highlight their development in subsequent years and to identify new topics.</p>
<p>We pivot our analysis based on citation intensity, concentrating on most cited papers normalized on their age since publication. The results are organized conceptually and are meant for general researchers and practitioners.</p>
<p>We follow four steps of <span class="citation">Herz et al. (2010)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>define the review scope</li>
<li>conceptualization of the topic (definitions of the topic: learning dashboards) -&gt; based on the previous review <span class="citation">Matcha et al. (2020)</span></li>
<li>literature search: journal search, database search, keyword search, backward (citations in the articles)/forward search (citations of the articles of keyword search)</li>
<li>literature analysis and synthesis (define main dimensions)</li>
</ul>
<p>We obtain topic keywords following the definitions of the 5E stages from three papers: <span class="citation">Eisenkraft (2003)</span>, <span class="citation">Duran and Duran (2004)</span>, and <span class="citation">Bybee et al. (2006)</span>. For the last stage of evolution, we adopt the descriptions of adaptive e-learning environments from <span class="citation">Özyurt and Özyurt (2015)</span>, <span class="citation">El-Sabagh (2021)</span>, and <span class="citation">Kolekar, Pai, and M M (2019)</span>.</p>
