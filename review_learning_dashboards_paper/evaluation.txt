The evaluation phase encourages students to assess their understanding and
abilities and provides opportunities for teachers to evaluate student progress
toward achieving the educational objectives.

The evaluate phase of the learning cycle continues to include
both formative and summative evaluations of student learning. If teachers truly value the learning cycle and experiments
that students conduct in the classroom, then teachers should be
sure to include aspects of these investigations on tests. Tests
should include questions from the lab and should ask students
questions about the laboratory activities. Students should be
asked to interpret data from a lab similar to the one they
completed. Students should also be asked to design experiments as part of their assessment

Assessment in an inquiry-based setting is very different to that in
traditional science lessons. Both formal and informal assessment approaches are
appropriate, and should be included. For instance, the use of non-traditional forms of
assessment, such as portfolios, performance-based assessment, concept maps,
physical models, or journal logs may serve as significant evidence of student
learning. During an inquiry-based lesson, assessment should be viewed as an
ongoing process, with teachers making observations of their students as they apply
new concepts and skills and looking for evidence that the students have changed or
modified their thinking. Students may also have the opportunity to conduct selfassessment or peer-assessment. However, the evaluation may also include a
summative experience such as a quiz, exam, or writing assignment.
