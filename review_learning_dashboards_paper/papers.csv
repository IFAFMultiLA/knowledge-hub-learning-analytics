However, research has been hindered by a lack of differentiation between usage and engagement and not recognising the heterogeneity of TEL applications. The current study aimed to assess the impact of emotional, cognitive and behavioural engagement with TEL on students’ grades and to also look at how motivation levels differentially predict engagement across different types of TEL. In a sample of 524 undergraduate students, we measured engagement and usage of TEL, student learning motivations and self-report student grades. Our results indicate that intrinsic motivations predict engagement, whilst extrinsic motivations predict usage. Importantly, engagement was predictive of grades whereas usage was not. Furthermore, when TEL was broken down by type, the use of social media groups was a significant predictor of grade, whereas reviewing lecture slides/ recordings, reading additional content and using course blogs/ discussion boards were not. We conclude that a sole focus on usage of TEL is misleading. Implications for researchers and educators are discussed.","engagement"

An experimental field study of the influence of badges on motivation, activity, and performance in an online learning course","2018-03-01","Over the last few years, the implementation of game elements like badges in non-game environments has become increasingly popular (Butler, 2014). In this study, we tested whether badges, which could be received for successful task performance and specific activities within an e-learning course in a higher education setting, had an impact on students' motivation and performance. In a between-subjects experimental field study, students were randomly assigned to three different conditions (no badges, badges visible to peers, badges only visible to students themselves). The results show that badges have less impact on motivation and performance than is commonly assumed. Independent of condition, students intrinsic motivation decreased over time. Contrary to expectation, the badges that could only be viewed by the students themselves were evaluated more positively than those that could also be viewed by others. Field experiment shows potential influences of badges in online course over time.Badges have less impact on motivation and performance than is commonly assumed.Badges do not hinder a decrease of students' intrinsic motivation over time.Badges did not seem to enable social comparison processes.","engagement"

However, previous studies of students’ perceptions of e-learning demonstrate a lack of consistent results with respect to the prediction of their academic achievement. The goal of this study was to examine university students’ perceptions of e-learning, based on their experiences, and the mediating roles of academic engagement and digital readiness within the university context of an e-learning environment for academic achievement. A total of 614 undergraduate students enrolled in a Korean university participated in this study. Using a partial least squares model to develop the theory, we examined students engaging in university e-learning environments in relation to their perceptions of e-learning, digital readiness, academic engagement, and academic achievement (i.e., grade point average). The results are significant for the importance of students’ academic engagement and digital readiness as mediators in their perceptions of e-learning predicted by academic achievement. Although students positively perceived e-learning experiences on campus, they must have strong digital skills to perform academic work and commit to effortful involvement in the context of academic learning in university e-learning environments. Our results provide practical implications for ways to enhance effective adoption of e-learning environments by college students, educators, and administrators.","engagement"

We investigated the role of SRL, specifically motivation, emotion, and learning strategies, in students’ learning experiences in a remedial online mathematics course. With an online survey of 229 college students, we found that student motivation explained a small portion of variance in achievement; whereas student motivation and emotion explained a significant portion of variance in satisfaction. In addition, significant differences in motivation and emotion were found in passing and nonpassing students; however, learning strategies did not influence student achievement and satisfaction. Implications for teaching and learning in self-paced online remedial mathematics courses are discussed.","engagement"

While the initial work on predictive modelling was focused on the development of general predictive models, portable across different learning settings, later studies demonstrated the drawbacks of not considering the specificities of course design and disciplinary context. This study builds on the methods and findings of related earlier studies to further explore factors predictive of learners' academic success in blended learning. In doing so, it differentiates itself by (i) relying on a larger and homogeneous course sample (15 courses, 50 course offerings in total), and (ii) considering both internal and external conditions as factors affecting the learning process. We apply mixed effect linear regression models, to examine: i) to what extent indicators of students' online learning behaviour can explain the variability in the final grades, and ii) to what extent that variability is attributable to the course and students' internal conditions, not captured by the logged data. Having examined different types of behaviour indicators (e.g., indicators of the overall activity level, those indicative of regularity of study, etc), we found little difference, if any, in their predictive power. Our results further indicate that a low proportion of variance is explained by the behaviour-based indicators, while a significant portion of variability stems from the learners' internal conditions. Hence, when variability in external conditions is largely controlled for (the same institution, discipline, and nominal pedagogical model), students’ internal state is the key predictor of their course performance. • Low portability of trace-based student success predictors across homogenous courses. • Low predictive power of online learning behaviour indicators in blended courses. • Activity level and regularity of study indicators have comparable predictive power. • Students' internal state can explain a large portion of variance in the course grades. • In similar course settings, study success relates most to students' internal state.","engagement"

Despite its adoption in higher education settings, little research has been done to examine factors influencing the adoption of mobile learning management systems (LMSs) and the learning effects on students' academic achievement. To explore the relationships among factors and the educational effectiveness of mobile LMSs, students' demographic backgrounds (age and employment status), self-reported psychological data (self-efficacy, innovativeness, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness of mobile LMSs), and external factors (subjective norms) were collected from 1604 students from 10 repetitions of the same course in an online university in Korea, in addition to their test scores. The logistic regression results showed that age and employment status were significant factors in predicting students' adoption of mobile LMSs and that there were potential connections between mobile LMS use and students' gender, age, and psychological characteristics. In addition, the study demonstrated that the use of a mobile LMS positively influenced online students' academic achievement. The findings from this empirical study present a better understanding of students' usage of mobile devices in higher education. Factors influencing the adoption of mobile LMS were investigated.The use of mobile LMS was affected by multi-dimensional characteristics of factors.The use of mobile LMS had a positive relationship with students' achievement.","engagement"

Data from a national online survey of 1671 faculty from 19 universities was analyzed using structural equation modeling. Support for the overall model showed faculty autonomy, competence, and relatedness positively predicted autonomous motivation (intrinsic, identified), but not controlled motivation (introjected, external). Autonomous motivation, in turn, predicted greater incorporation of effective teaching strategies, namely instructional clarity, higher-order learning, reflective and integrative learning, and collaborative learning. There were no differences found across faculty at Doctoral, Master’s, and Bachelor’s institutions in terms of autonomous motivation mean levels, nor for the predictive effects of autonomous motivation on teaching best practices. The findings have implications for the faculty motivation and teaching research literatures, as well as for faculty development initiatives aimed at improving teaching effectiveness.","engagement"

The gamified online learning environment was used by 40 undergraduate students, and the data gathered from them. A hypothetical path model showing the interaction of variables with each other was suggested and tested. The experience of flow and emotional engagement in the gamified learning setting had a highly significant impact on motivation. Furthermore, it was concluded that flow increased academic success through increasing motivation. In line with numerous studies in the literature, motivation was determined to have a positive effect on academic success. In addition, the results show that flow and emotional engagement explained 68% of variance of motivation; flow, emotional engagement, and motivation explained 22% of variance of academic success. It is suggested that subsequent studies should focus on the establishment and testing of models that would help to explain success in gamified settings which should incorporate game elements and player types in the structural model.","engagement"

A majority of MOOCs students are not fully engaged in MOOCs, thus leading them to quit in the early stage of the courses. Therefore, it is important to investigate students' engagement in MOOCs. Drawing on self‐determination theory and the theory of relationship quality, this study proposes a model that conceptualizes the MOOCs engagement as consisting of psychological engagement and behavioral engagement and explores the antecedents of students' engagement in MOOCs. The research model is tested using data collected from 374 students of Chinese University MOOC. The results show that fulfillment of three basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness have significant positive effects on intrinsic motivation, increasing students' psychological engagement in MOOCs. Relationship quality significantly predicts students' psychological engagement, and psychological engagement promotes behavioral engagement in MOOCs. Implications for research and practice as well as limitations of this study are discussed finally. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]","engagement"

The main purpose of this study is to analyze the structural relationships of these constructs with teachers' autonomous motivation and work engagement. Data were collected from 350 in-service secondary education teachers through a self-report questionnaire and were analyzed using a two-step Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach. After testing the adequacy of the measurement model, the structural model showed that all ICT-related variables significantly predicted autonomous motivation, with 26% of explained variance. ICT-related variables and autonomous motivation explained 69% of the variance of work engagement. Emotional variables also were predicted by digital self-efficacy and institutional support. Autonomous motivation and emotional variables mediated the effects of digital self-efficacy and support for innovation on work engagement. These results shed light on the critical role of these ICT-related variables for teachers’ work motivation and engagement.","engagement"

Driven by developments in the emerging field of learning analytics, these technologies adjust problems based on learners' performance. Yet, until now it is largely unclear how students regulate their learning with ALTs. Hence, we explored how learners regulate their effort, accuracy and learning with an ALT using moment-by-moment learning curves. The results indicated that moment-by-moment learning curves did reflect students’ accuracy and learning, but no associations with effort were found. Immediate drops were associated with high prior knowledge and suboptimal learning. Immediate peaks were associated with robust learning and pointed to effective student regulation. Close multiple spikes showed moderate learning and lower initial levels of accuracy but, with system support, these students seemed able to regulate their learning. Separated multiple spikes indicated reduced learning and accuracy and potentially signal the inability of students to regulate their learning. In this light, moment-by-moment learning curves seem to be valuable indicators of accuracy regulation during learning with ALTs and could potentially be used in interventions to support SRL with personalized visualizations. • Children show differential effort and accuracy regulation while learning with ALTs. • Moment-by-moment learning curves are associated to childrens' accuracy and learning . • Moment-by-moment learning curves are indicative learners efficiency of regulation over time.","engagement"

In the original article, one of the studies discussed (Praetorius et al., 2017), was incorrectly interpreted. The longitudinal study findings from Praetorius et al (2017) challenged the assumption that TSE may be an antecedent construct. When teachers’ stable inter-individual differences were taken into account, there were no significant cross-lagged effects from TSE to teaching quality (or vice versa).] It is often assumed that low levels of teacher self-efficacy (TSE) leads to negative outcomes, including burnout; however, the temporal order of the construct predictions has rarely been examined. We used an autoregressive cross-lagged panel design to examine whether TSE and burnout are concurrently associated with each other, whether TSE predicts future burnout levels, and/or whether burnout predicts future TSE levels. An initial sample of 3,002 Croatian teachers (82% female) from across three educational levels (i.e., elementary, middle, and secondary schools) with varying years of teaching experiences (M = 15.28, SD = 10.50) completed questionnaires on their levels of TSE and burnout (exhaustion and disengagement) at 3 time points (at approximately 6-month intervals). We found that burnout has a more prominent role in predicting future levels of TSE than TSE does in predicting future levels of burnout. These findings challenge the theoretical and empirical conceptualizations assuming that TSE is a predictor of burnout. Policies and interventions that focus on decreasing teacher burnout rather than increasing TSE levels may be best. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","engagement"

We examined the extent to which perceived autonomy support predicts basic psychological need satisfaction and, in turn, whether need satisfaction predicts teachers’ perceptions of well-being, motivation, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. Participants were 485 Canadian school teachers (76% female) who completed an online questionnaire. After confirming the measurement model with factor analysis, the hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling. Findings indicated that perceived autonomy support positively predicted need satisfaction, and, in turn, need satisfaction predicted the work-related perceptions. Of particular importance were the differing roles played by the basic psychological needs in predicting each of the work-related perceptions. Additional analyses revealed that well-being and motivation played key mediating roles in how need satisfaction was associated with job satisfaction (but less so with commitment) and that teachers’ personal characteristics played minor moderating roles in influencing how teachers’ workplace beliefs and perceptions were associated. Together, the study’s findings enable a greater depth of understanding about teachers’ psychological functioning at work, which is important for healthy teachers and effective teaching and learning.

This cross-sectional study involved a survey distributed to 22 Saudi Arabian universities. The survey used in this study consisted of an online learning self-efficacy (OLSE) questionnaire and an electronic learning (e-learning) satisfaction questionnaire. A total of 1,226 respondents voluntarily participated in and completed the survey. Students in medical fields made up 289 (23.6%). A Kruskal-Wallis H test and a chi-square test were used to compare the student's satisfaction based on the educational variables. Spearman's correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess the association between self-efficacy and satisfaction. The findings revealed degrees of satisfaction ranging between high satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The majority of students (51%) expressed high satisfaction, and 599 students (49%) reported experiencing a low level of satisfaction with e-learning. A comparison of groups with low and high satisfaction scores revealed a significant difference in the OLSE. High satisfaction was positively correlated with the OLSE domains: time management, technology, and learning. The OLSE regression analysis model significantly predicted satisfaction. It showed that the model, corrected for education level and grade point average of the students, significantly predicted e-learning satisfaction (F = 8.04, R2 = 0.59, p = .004). The study concluded that students' satisfaction with the e-learning experience is influenced by e-learning self-efficacy. The study's findings lead to the practical implications and identify the need to improve the remote learning, time management and technology self-efficacy to enhance students' satisfaction.","engagement"

More importantly, teachers' online learning behaviors were collected and used as indicates of learning engagement. 520 teachers involved in a training program were surveyed. The results of regression analyses showed that teachers' perceived task value positively predicted their online learning engagement. Moreover, teachers' motivational regulation played a partial mediating role in the predicting power of perceived task value to learning engagement. In addition, the first half of the mediating path among perceived task value, motivational regulation, and learning engagement was moderated by teachers' self-efficacy. The moderating effect on motivational regulation was higher for teachers with a high sense of self-efficacy than those with a low sense of self-efficacy. Therefore, it was suggested to assign learning tasks that meet the needs of teachers and pay attention to the cultivation of teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs to increase their learning engagement in online professional learning communities.

Previous research has examined the overall effects of leaderboard versus a no leaderboard condition but paid less attention to how positions on different types of leaderboard may affect students' learning performance, intrinsic motivation, and course engagement. In the two studies, we exposed 50 postgraduate students from two fully online courses to two types of leaderboard (absolute and relative) and measured their learning performance, course engagement, intrinsic motivation, and perceptions. Results suggest that the absolute leaderboard helps intensify students’ sense of comparison and competitiveness more than the relative leaderboard. In the absolute leaderboard class, students at different positions showed similar levels of learning performance and course engagement, but a higher position was associated with higher intrinsic motivation. Conversely, in the relative leaderboard class, students ranked in the top third tended to display better learning performance than their peers in the lower two thirds did. Students who ranked in different positions showed similar levels of course engagement and intrinsic motivation for learning. Qualitative analyses based on a survey suggested that the students ranked in the bottom third preferred anonymous (vs public) comparison on an absolute leaderboard but favoured public (vs anonymous) comparison on a relative leaderboard. Most students reported positive attitude toward the use of leaderboards for sustaining comparison and competitiveness. • Examines two specific types of leaderboards: absolute and relative. • Examines the effects of positions on leaderboards on student learning performance. • Examines the effects of positions on leaderboards on student engagement and motivation. • Student preference of public or anonymous comparison depends on leaderboard type. • Provides practical guide for implementing two types of leaderboard.","engagement"

Yet, little is known on the motivational beliefs of students towards online assignment, and none on how in combination they affect student behavior when it comes to online assignment. This present study aims to identify online assignment motivation profiles based on achievement goal theory (mastery- and performance-approach goals) and expectancy-value theory (expectancy and value components). Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to examine if homogenous latent profiles exist within a sample of 612 college students in China. Our findings identified four distinct profiles: High Motivation , Moderate Motivation , Low Goal Orientation/Moderate Expectancy-Value , and Very High Goal Orientation/Very Low Expectancy-Value . Our findings further revealed that profile membership was associated with self-regulation of online assignment behavior, including handling distraction, arranging the environment, managing time, monitoring motivation, emotion management, and cognitive reappraisal. Finally, supplemental analyses showed the added benefit of integrating both achievement goal and expectancy-value theories when forming online assignment motivation profiles. These findings indicated the importance of promoting multiple motivational beliefs to better support self-regulation of online assignment behavior. The present study suggests that understanding online assignment motivation profiles can provide new insights into promoting an adaptive online learning environment and help online instructors enhance and sustain their students’ motivation with online assignment (e.g., to provide differentiated support based on the motivational needs of online students in each profile). • We identified four different online assignment motivation profiles. • Profile membership was related to self-regulation of online assignment behavior. • We found added benefits of integrating expectancy-value and achievement goal theories.","engagement"

In higher online education, information on these relationships is lacking, while this group of learners is growing in size and importance. We therefore investigated the total as well as the unique predictive value of academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and grit on academic success in higher online education. Moreover, mediation effects were investigated. Students of a higher online education university in the Netherlands participated ( N = 2027, age 18–80 years) in this observational study. Participants filled out online questionnaires on the variables of interest and potential confounding variables at baseline. Academic success was measured objectively through information provided by the exam registration office and operationalized in three variables: exam attempt, study progress, and academic performance. Logistic regression analyses showed that consistency of interests significantly predicted exam attempt ( B = .43, p &lt; .001). Generalized multiple linear regression analyses with negative binomial distribution showed that consistency of interests was a significant predictor of study progress ( B = .16, p &lt; .001). Mixed model analyses revealed no significant predictors for academic performance ( p s &gt; .06). The fact that of our three predictors solely consistency of interests was found to be predictive for academic success indicates that online educational institutes should pay attention to consistency of interests of their students to improve the academic success rates.","engagement"

However, relatively little research drawing from self-determination theory has examined the links between teaching motivations and student engagement. To this end, this study was conducted to survey 414 Chinese college students’ perceptions of teaching motivations, their own intrinsic and extrinsic motivations during the learning process, as well as their engagement with online learning. The findings indicated that the survey had satisfactory validity and internal consistency. Structural equation model revealed the interrelationships between autonomy-supportive teaching motivations, controlling teaching motivations, student intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, and student engagement. The results showed that in online learning environments, autonomy-supportive teaching motivations and student intrinsic motivation were positively related to student engagement. Unexpectedly, controlling teaching motivations and student extrinsic motivation had no significant effect on student engagement. Moreover, the mediating effects of student intrinsic motivation including perceived autonomy, competence, and relatedness offered a deeper understanding of the association between autonomy-supportive teaching motivations and student engagement. The main findings and practical implications together are discussed in depth. Implications for practice or policy: Teachers could adopt autonomy-supportive teaching strategies and stimulate students’ intrinsic motivation as they have shown to be positive factors for student engagement. Developers and educators could enhance student engagement through nurturing inner motivational resources in online learning environment. Researchers could verify more factors that influence student engagement and clarify how they could be manipulated in future studies.","engagement"

There is a growing consensus that an instructor's emotional expressions can trigger students' emotional and psychological responses, thus enhancing or inhibiting their learning in both face-to-face and online teaching contexts. However, little systematic research exists on which specific design features of an instructor's movements can induce emotions in video lectures. Three experiments were conducted in this study. Experiment 1 aimed to test the congruency/incongruency effects of an instructor's facial expressions (happy vs. bored) and body gestures (happy vs. bored) on student learning from video lectures in terms of students' emotions, motivation, cognitive load, and learning performance. Results of Experiment 1 showed that the instructor's happy facial expressions induced more positive emotions, enhanced motivation, and improved learning performance in students than the bored facial expressions, regardless of the instructor's body gestures. Experiment 2 sought to build upon the unexpected finding from Experiment 1 by increasing the frequency of body gestures, seeking evidence from both self-reports and eye movements. Results of Experiment 2 showed that the instructor's happy facial expressions enhanced students' learning performance when the instructor did not use body gestures, but not when they used increased body gestures. Experiment 3 was conducted to further expand upon findings from Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Results of Experiment 3 confirmed the emotion-motivational and cognitive benefits of the instructor's happy facial expressions. The results have implications for designing features of instructors in video lectures: if instructors are visible, they should be encouraged to exhibit happy facial expressions, using body gestures less frequently or even avoid body gestures entirely. • An instructor's happy facial expressions induced students' more positive emotions, compared with the bored face. • An instructor's happy facial expressions enhanced students' motivation, compared with the bored facial expressions. • An instructor's happy facial expressions in isolation from body gestures directed students' more attention to the slides. • An instructor's happy facial expressions accompanied by less frequent or no body gestures improved learning performance.","engagement"

Inclusive definitions and models, and diverse conceptualizations, mean that essentially all types of education that include some aspect of face-to-face learning and online learning is described as blended learning in the literature. Blended learning has become an umbrella term. Blended learning is also used to describe other blends, such as combining different instructional methods, pedagogical approaches and technologies, although these blends are not aligned with influential blended learning definitions. Since blended learning has many meanings, it is important that researchers and practitioners carefully explain what blended learning means to them. It is also suggested that alternative, more descriptive terms, could be used as a complement or replacement to blended learning.","exploration"

The flipped sessions comprised pre-recorded lectures, online quizzes and in-class group activities in the course design. The success of the approach was evaluated on the basis of perceptions held by the course coordinator and students on how the new course design influenced the student learning experience. Data were collected through a student questionnaire and structured interviews with the course coordinator. Overall, the students reported a high degree of satisfaction with some elements of the flipped approach. However, some activities were less well regarded, with concerns identified by the course coordinator and students. A key finding was that elements from the model for student learning design presented in this article were correlated with student confidence, motivation and engagement. It was concluded that refinements of components of the flipped design, such as the pre-recorded lectures and the structure of the in-class sessions, may further enhance the student learning experience in this course.","exploration"

Many instructors, however, have found developing effective online lessons in a very short period of time very stressful and difficult. This study describes how we successfully addressed this crisis by transforming two conventional flipped classes into fully online flipped classes with the help of a cloud-based video conferencing app. As in a conventional flipped course, in a fully online flipped course students are encouraged to complete online pre-class work. But unlike in the conventional flipped approach, students do not subsequently meet face-to-face in physical classrooms, but rather online. This study examines the effect of fully online flipped classrooms on student learning performance in two stages. In Stage One, we explain how we drew on the 5E framework to design two conventional flipped classes. The 5E framework consists of five phases-Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. In Stage Two, we describe how we transformed the two conventional flipped classes into fully online flipped classes. Quantitative analyses of students' final course marks reveal that the participants in the fully online flipped classes performed as effectively as participants in the conventional flipped learning classes. Our qualitative analyses of student and staff reflection data identify seven good practices for videoconferencing-assisted online flipped classrooms.","exploration"

An eye-tracking analysis","2020-03-01","Abstract An increasing number of instructional videos online integrate a real instructor on the video screen. So far, the empirical evidence from previous studies has been limited and conflicting, and none of the studies have explored how learners' allocation of visual attention to the on-screen instructor influences learning and learner perceptions. Therefore, this study aimed to disentangle a) how instructor presence in online videos affects learning, learner perceptions (i.e., cognitive load, judgment of learning, satisfaction, situational interest), and visual attention distribution and b) to what extent visual attention patterns in instructor-present videos predict learning and learner perceptions. Sixty college students each watched two videos on Statistics, one on an easy topic and the other one on a difficult topic, with each in one of the two video formats: instructor-present or instructor-absent. Their eye movements were simultaneously registered using a desktop-mounted eye tracker. Afterwards, participants self-reported their cognitive load, judgment of learning, satisfaction, and situational interest for both videos, and feelings toward seeing the instructor for the instructor-present videos. Learning from the two videos was measured using retention and transfer questions. Findings indicated instructor presence a) improved transfer performance for the difficult topic, b) reduced cognitive load for the difficult topic, c) increased judgment of learning for the difficult topic, and d) enhanced satisfaction and situational interest for both topics. Most participants expressed a positive feeling toward the instructor. Results also showed the instructor attracted a considerable amount of overt visual attention in both videos, and the amount of attention allocated to the instructor positively predicted participants’ satisfaction level for both topics.","exploration"

Feedback dialogue has been conceptualised as the dynamic interplay of three dimensions: the cognitive, the social-affective and the structural. We sought to explore the interactional features of each dimension and their intermediary effects on students. We analysed students’ feedback dialogue excerpts as cases using interactional analysis. Analysis involved iterative inductive and deductive coding, and interpretation of feedback texts generated in an online course.

However, there are significant executive function and language processing demands that may be particularly challenging for this population. With that in mind, interventions guided by social presence theory may increase students' ability to engage in online settings. This study implemented a computer mediated, blended classroom setting in order to assess students’ understanding of statistics concepts following synchronous and asynchronous online, video-based discussion sessions. Social presence theory predicts that the immediacy of synchronous interactions should improve social presence, thereby increasing student engagement and performance. Data was collected from 105 students with high-incidence disabilities using a mixed methods experimental design with a within subjects quantitative component. Our findings indicate that while students with disabilities expressed preference for synchronous discussions, including self-reported greater engagement and self-reported improved comprehension, their performance on assessments of conceptual understanding was slightly better following asynchronous discussions. Implications for these disparities between preference and performance are discussed. • Social presence was manipulated by comparing synchronous and asynchronous discussions. • Students with disabilities expressed preference for synchronous discussions. • Greater comprehension was self-reported in the synchronous condition. • Performance on test of conceptual understanding was better in asynchronous condition. • Cognitive demands were higher in the synchronous condition.","exploration"

This qualitative case study reports the use of a community of inquiry instructional approach to exploring the effects of the presences on shaping the experiences of online and face-to-face students and their instructor. The students and instructor interviews, video recordings and class observations over an entire engineering drawing course were collected for data analysis with the use of a coding scheme derived from the presences. The findings revealed that attainment of the intended learning outcomes relied more on the teaching presence than on the social and cognitive presences of the approach. The instructor's performance could bring about a leadership role of teaching presence as being more important than the social and cognitive presences in the engineering course. However, the instructional effects of the teaching, social and cognitive presences contributing to the blended synchronous learning and teaching mode were situational and context specific. Implications for further research are discussed. The CoI framework was regarded as an instructional approach.Teaching, social and cognitive presences were integrated as the instructional components.The teaching presence component might play a prominent role.This role was interpreted as e-teacher leadership in the blended synchronous mode.The instructional effects of the three presences were situational and context specific.","exploration"

Protocols, which are highly structured discussion strategies designed to promote trust, equity, and diversity, have the potential to address some of these challenges. This exploratory study used a design based research methodology to iteratively design, implement, and assess a blended synchronous learning environment leveraging the use of protocols in a graduate education course. Across three iterations, a combination of qualitative data collection and analysis procedures were used to examine the influence of protocols on the experiences of the instructor and students in a blended synchronous environment. The findings included several assertions. Students appreciated taking on greater leadership roles through facilitating protocols when they perceived the outcome of their facilitation successful. Students became hyperaware of the time when the technology caused timing issues with the protocols. Trust of the protocol was hindered by the unpredictability of the blended synchronous learning environment. And, deep connections to texts were unachievable due to the multitasking required in blended synchronous settings. These findings resulted in a set of contextualized design propositions that contribute to the literature on both protocols and blended synchronous environments. The propositions included: (a) enabling active participation through distributed roles, (b) creating equity through flexible structures, (c) fostering trust through re-norming, and (d) prompting connections with texts by reducing task complexity.","exploration"

By using both quantitative content and lag sequential analysis, this study investigated students' interaction patterns and dynamic learning sentiments by performing seven types of learning tasks on an asynchronous discussion platform. The research participants were 38 postgraduate students. The results revealed that, compared to students performing the individual-oriented learning tasks, those performing the group-oriented ones had more diverse learning sentiments and interaction patterns, and deeper interactions with regard to learning sentiments. In addition, their learning sentiments exhibited a periodic feature during the process of online learning. Based on the results, we presented a four-phase model for describing a process of diverse interactions in online learning environments. In particular, this model characterizes the interactions with dynamic learning sentiments including generation, collision and integration, refinement, as well as stability.","exploration"

The investigation involved a procedure carried out over 14 weeks in an online collaborative learning environment. During the procedure, the knowledge building process was executed over Knowledge Forum and the planning process over Moodle LMS. The scaffolds, quantity, content and quality of interaction and participation, and relations between scaffolds and the quantity of interaction and participation were reviewed. The participants were 145 prospective teachers. In this research, a convergent parallel design method was employed. Data were collected from multiple sources, including the log records and the content analysis of Knowledge Forum postings. Development was observed in terms of the use of opinion building and expressing forms and note creation and build-on of the students in the knowledge building processes within the online collaborative learning environment. Furthermore, most of the academic content and the quality of interaction and participation were indicators of progress of the individual student and groups of students. There was a significant increase in the quality of interaction and participation from the beginning of the term to the end of term. It is suggested that the 14-week knowledge building process contributed to learning. It was found that there was a significant relation between the use of opinion building and expressing forms and the creation and build-on of notes by the students. Results show that the course offered in an online collaborative knowledge building environment contributed to opinion building and expression, the quantity, content and quality of interaction and participation, and thus the learning of students.

This study used a multi‐method approach to examine the relationship between students' social participatory roles and cognitive engagement levels within asynchronous online discussions. Results showed that students' social participatory role was a critical indicator of cognitive engagement level. Socially active students made more cognitive contributions to knowledge inquiry and knowledge construction. But there were exceptions: after taking leadership roles (i.e., discussion designers and facilitators), some students moved from peripheral participation to active participation. Second, there was a progressive development process: individual students' deep‐level knowledge inquiry could trigger peer interaction, which could further advance group knowledge construction. Third, students had a tendency to keeping social‐cognitive engagement patterns throughout discussions. Based on the result, this study proposed implications for collaborative learning theory, pedagogy support, and tool development. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]","exploration"

It influences the way how social interaction unfolds online and affects learning and social outcomes. However, what precisely social presence is has been under debate, as presently a plethora of different definitions and measures exist preventing the development of a coherent research field regarding social presence and its defining role in online group learning. To solve the issue, we went back to the original social presence theory as devised by the communication researchers Short et al. (1976) to show that although they had a clear idea of social presence—namely “realness” of other persons in the interaction—their definition is ambiguous, not operationalizable, and the measurement of it questionable. We, therefore, disentangled their social presence theory and (1) reformulated the social presence definition to enable an operationalization in line with the previous conceptualization of social presence; (2) departed from the technological determinism of social presence; and (3) identified two other constructs closely linked to social presence, namely, sociability (as a medium attribute) and social space (as a group attribute). By reformulating the definition of social presence and by linking it to social space and sociability, we hope to contribute to a more coherent line of social presence research and to better understand interpersonal communication, group learning, and group dynamics when learning and working together in an online setting.","exploration"

Online instructors are increasingly using video in various ways, but questions remain on which types of videos students value most when it comes to establishing social presence. Given this, this mixed-methods sequential explanatory study explored student perceptions of three types of asynchronous video: video announcements, instructional videos, and video feedback. The results suggest that while video has the potential to improve social presence, it ultimately depends on both how the video is used in the online classroom as well as students’ individual preferences.

However, despite this use, online instructors and students have expressed concerns and limitations with asynchronous communication. Research suggests that synchronous communication technology may address some of the limitations of asynchronous communication. Further, advances in synchronous video-based communication technology make it easier than ever to incorporate synchronous communication technology into online courses. However, comparatively, little is known about online instructors’ experiences and perceptions of using synchronous communication technologies in online courses and how they think they can help with community development. The purpose of this study was to explore instructors’ experiences and perceptions of synchronous communication technology. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 18 online instructors resulted in the following themes: (a) instructors use synchronous communication technology in multiple and various ways in online courses; (b) the perceived benefits of real-time visual communication outweigh the drawbacks identified; (c) the benefits of nonverbal communication depend on situational factors and how synchronous features are used; (d) productive and meaningful interaction requires intentional yet flexible facilitation during synchronous sessions; (e) synchronous sessions can provide a place for community to build and grow but they are not required for community development. Altogether, findings suggest that real-time visual communication may aid in community building in online courses but that its effectiveness depends on several situational factors, and that synchronous lecturing may be less conducive to developing classroom community in online courses.

To bridge this gap, this study adopted a case-study approach to investigate six Chinese university students' learner identities constructed in the online and offline sessions of a blended English for academic purposes (EAP) course focusing on collaborative writing. Data included class observations and recordings, history logs on the writing platform, and semi-structured interviews. Different types of learner identities were identified from participants' verbal characteristics in offline classroom discussions (i.e., Group Leader, Spokesperson, Summarizer, and Follower) and from their writing revisions on the online writing platform (i.e., Industrious Contributor, Prudent Reader, Procrastinator, and Cooperative Writer). Both individual and contextual factors were found to influence the construction of learner identity in the blended learning environment for collaborative writing. The study also found that some students maintained their learner identities across the two cohesive learning sessions of the blended course whereas others did not. These findings provide implications for course design, pedagogical practice, and materials development. • Learner identity (LI) construction in blended collaborative writing was examined. • Various LIs were identified in the online and offline sessions of blended learning. • LI construction displayed different patterns across the online and offline sessions. • Both individual and contextual factors influenced LI construction.","exploration"

Moreover, research focusing on preparing future teachers for ICT integration is generally limited to the impact of one single strategy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test a model to explain pre-service teachers' perceived ICT competencies that integrates pre-service teachers' background characteristics (age and gender), their ICT profile (e.g., attitudes towards ICT) and the multiple strategies pre-service teachers experience in their teacher training institution: 1) using teacher educators as role models, 2) reflecting on the role of technology in education, 3) learning how to use technology by design, 4) collaboration with peers, 5) scaffolding authentic technology experiences, and 6) continuous feedback. Based on a survey among 931 final-year pre-service teachers in Flanders (Belgium), the multilevel analyses indicated a positive association between the strategies and pre-service teachers' ICT competencies. The more pre-service teachers perceive the occurrences of the strategies during their teacher education, the higher their perceived competence to use ICT for learning processes and to strengthen their instructional practice. Gender and age did not affect pre-service teachers' ICT competence for educational practice. Furthermore, the results revealed a positive impact of pre-service teachers’ attitudes towards ICT (in education) and ease of use, on their ICT competence for educational practice. These results can provide guidance for the preparation of pre-service teachers for the 21st century learning environments with new technologies.","explanation"

Whether and how pre-service teachers' acquisition of TPACK could be supported is still an open question, as previous research predominantly relied on correlational data and/or self-report assessments. Based on previous research, we developed subject-specific versions of a TPACK-module to support the acquisition of TPACK. Further purpose of the TPACK-module was to enhance technology-related motivation, as motivational orientations have been documented to be crucial for technology integration. We evaluated the effectiveness of the module by means of a quasi-experimental field study. Pre-service teachers (N = 208), enrolled in five subjects, attended regular semester courses on subject-matter pedagogies. In half of the courses, we randomly implemented subject-specific TPACK-modules (duration: three weeks), in which pre-service teachers were taught in using technology for subject-matter teaching, whereas the control condition attended the regular courses without the TPACK-module. We found that pre-service teachers in the courses with the TPACK-modules acquired more TPACK than those in the control courses without the TPACK-modules. Significant effects were also obtained for pre-service teachers' technology-related self-efficacy and their perceived support for technology integration. The effectiveness of the TPACK-modules could be explained by the obtained support for technology integration. The findings highlight the central need of adequate support for pre-service teachers’ development of technology-related professional knowledge and motivation in teacher education programs. • We developed a subject-specific intervention to foster pre-service teachers' TPACK. • The intervention was based on evidence-based practices of teacher education. • Effects were tested in a cluster randomized study in 5 subjects across three weeks. • TPACK was measured by test-based instruments. • Effects were obtained for TPACK, self-efficacy, and subjective support.","explanation"

Data were collected from a sample of 284 teacher educators in Flanders, the Dutch‐speaking part of Belgium, and submitted to latent profile analysis. The added value of the current study lies in the account of how SQD strategies and a typical set of determinants of ICT integration can be associated within teacher educators' profile. Based on the profiles emerging from this study, teacher training institutions should consider their teacher educators to be gatekeepers when preparing future generations of teachers for the learning environments of the twenty‐first century. In the discussion section, the implications for practice and future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]","explanation"

One problem with teachers' ICT competences is the proliferation of various frameworks which entail a lack of definition of these competences. The objective of this article is twofold: to establish a basic framework that shapes the subsets of ICT competences (technological and pedagogical) in all teachers at all levels (Primary, Secondary and Higher Education); to determine how various personal and contextual factors influence these subsets. For this purpose, a study of secondary analysis has been made with data from two survey design studies on teachers' ICT competences that collect information from a sample of 1095 male and female Primary, Secondary and Higher Education teachers in the Valencian Community (east Spain). A Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes Model (MIMIC) was used to validate the teachers' ICT competences model. The study results indicated that teachers' ICT competences form a unique set composed of two subsets, technological competences and pedagogical competences. Moreover, the technological competences influenced the pedagogical ones. We also found that personal and contextual factors have a relevant impact on the competences subsets. This article helped clarify and delimit the framework of teachers' ICT competences. Besides, this basic model of ICT competences should be a key element for teacher training in ICT. This article also shows how the influence of personal and contextual factors must be considered when designing training plans. This study determines a basic ICT competences model for teachers of all levels.The basic ICT model is composed of technological and pedagogical competences.Technological competences influence pedagogical competences.Personal and contextual factors have a key impact on the ICT competences.","explanation"

Specifically, we focused on the strategies included in the synthesis of qualitative evidence (SQD) model: (1) using teacher educators as role models, (2) reflecting on the role of technology in education, (3) learning how to use technology by design, (4) collaboration with peers, (5) scaffolding authentic technology experiences, and (6) providing continuous feedback. To explore the relation between the perceived occurrences of the SQD-strategies and TPACK (controlled for pre-service teachers’ general attitudes towards technology), survey data were collected from a sample of 688 final-year pre-service teachers in Belgium. In a next step, 16 telephone interviews and 6 in-depth interviews were conducted to gain a more in-depth insight into the nature of the 6 strategies and their influences on TPACK. The quantitative analyses indicated positive correlations between the SQD-strategies and TPACK, controlled for general attitudes towards technology. The findings from the qualitative analyses showed that teachers acknowledged the importance of the six strategies. However, the respondents emphasized that some of the six strategies are often underutilized. Based on the quantitative and qualitative results, the discussion provides recommendations to improve the potential of pre-service training to enhance future teachers’ TPACK.","explanation"

The participants in this study were 21 early career secondary mathematics teachers who had completed an undergraduate mathematics teacher preparation program in the USA with a strong emphasis on the use of technology to teach mathematics. In this qualitative study, interview data were collected and analyzed with attention toward why teachers choose to use technology to teach mathematics, what tools they chose to use and why, as well as the general factors they consider when selecting particular technology tools. Findings indicate that one of the most important factors when deciding whether to use technology was how well it aligned with the goals of a lesson. The range of technology used spanned mathematical action tools, collaboration tools, assessment tools, and communication tools. When selecting particular tools teachers most heavily considered ease of use for both themselves and their students. These findings suggest that when considering how to infuse technology into teacher education programs we suggest that it is important to focus more broadly on types of tools, ways teachers can position them, and how particular activities align with specific mathematics learning objectives.","explanation"

To select, match and support groups of teachers for particular school projects, school principals could be supported with insights into teachers’ beliefs about teaching, learning and technology. A teacher typology has been developed based on an online questionnaire completed by 1602 teachers from 59 Dutch secondary schools. Teachers are grouped on the basis of their beliefs about learned-centered teaching and attitudes towards technology, which underlie the school innovations that form the context of the current research. Five teacher types are distinguished: 1) Learner-centered teachers with technology, 2) Teachers critical of technology use in school, 3) Teachers uncomfortable with technology, 4) Teachers uneasy with learned-centered teaching and 5) Teachers critical of a clear-cut stance. This classification of teachers into these five types could be used to select or match the right group of teachers to a particular intervention or to organize different professional development activities for different types of school teachers.","explanation"

However, meaningful 3D printing integration in K-12 curricula is still scarce, and little is known about how teachers' beliefs and the integration in science classrooms may influence student motivation. This study examined the influence of teachers' beliefs and 3D printing integration in science classrooms on students' science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) motivation, which is essential for students' academic experiences and future careers. Study sample included 26 teachers across 6 states in the U.S. and 1,501 students who engaged with STEM learning using 3D printing in the context of paleontology. Teachers' lesson plans were analyzed to examine 3D printing and STEM integration levels. Teachers' beliefs and students' STEM motivation were assessed with previously validated scales. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that while teachers' beliefs and 3D printing integration levels were non-significant predictors, teachers' STEM integration levels positively predicted students’ math motivation. Interaction effects were observed between student variables (student gender and pretest scores) and teacher variables (teacher beliefs and 3D printing integration). This study provides implications for both 3D printing integration practice and future research.","explanation"

To ensure the quality of STEM instruction, countries worldwide have launched STEM teacher professional development (TPD) programs. It is paramount to know how these programs have been implemented and what lessons can be learned from them. In this study, to capture the trends in publications on K-12 STEM TPD, we systematically reviewed relevant journal papers published in the Web of Science database from 2006 to 2020. We analyzed the (1) knowledge foci, (2) professional development approaches, (3) outcome measurements, as well as (4) data sources of the STEM TPDs. In addition, to inform future professional development designs, we selected and developed narrative descriptions of three exemplary cases. These cases showcased high-quality TPD and covered pre-service and in-service teachers in formal and informal settings. We reviewed the knowledge foci of the STEM TPDs using the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. The results showed that the types of knowledge delivered in the STEM TPD programs were mostly pedagogical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, while a certain number of programs focused on technological content knowledge and technological pedagogical content knowledge. Most of the studies adopted mixed professional development approaches, featuring activities like learning by design, learning by doing, reflective learning, and group work. These approaches emphasized the active participation of teachers in the process, built links between content and classroom practices, and encouraged collective participation in developing expertise. However, the data were mostly collected through interviews or survey instruments. Future research should move beyond analyzing data on teachers’ perceptions to explore processes (e.g., online participation logs, teacher-peer interactions) and products of performance (e.g., lesson plans, handmade crafts) to further examine the effects of STEM TPD activities. It would also be desirable to establish greater consistency in data collection approaches, such as by using validated interview or observation protocols that are generalizable to different school settings. • Analyzed the research trends on K-12 STEM teacher professional development. • Identified the knowledge foci of the professional development programs. • Examined the commonly adopted approaches in the professional development programs. • Investigated the commonly measured issues in the professional development studies. • Synthesized exemplary practices on upgrading STEM teachers' skills and expertise.","explanation"

Twelve teachers and three school leaders participated in the study. Data was collected through interviews. Findings showed that the continuation of technology use differed for the teachers involved in the professional development program. While all teachers reported to have gained knowledge and skills through the professional development program and were positive about technology use in education, only some teachers continued the use of technology. The data revealed that despite the challenges that all teachers in the sample encountered when using technology in their teaching (such as large classrooms, problems with electricity supply, lack of time and lack of technology tools), the encouragement of school management was a critical factor in teachers' continuation of technology use.

However, the empirical evidence of the impact of programmes that adopt ICT in schooling is mixed. Theory suggests it may be due to differences in whether or not the ICT programmes are integrated into a teaching programme of a class. Unfortunately, few empirical studies compare the relative effectiveness of programmes that integrate ICT into teaching with the ones that do not. In order to understand the most effective way to design new programmes that attempt to utilize ICT to improve English learning, we conducted a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) with some schools receiving ICT that was integrated into the teaching programme of the class; with some schools that received ICT without having it integrated into the teaching programme; and with other schools being used as controls. The RCT involved 6304 fifth grade students studying English in 127 rural schools in rural China. Our results indicate that when the programme is integrated into the teaching programme of a class it is effective in improving student test scores relative to the control schools. No programme impact, however, is found when the ICT programme is not integrated into the teaching program. We also find that when ICT programmes are integrated into teaching, the programmes work similarly for students that have either high or low initial (or baseline) levels of English competency. When ICT programmes are not integrated with teaching, they only raise the educational performance of English students who were performing better during the baseline. We conducted a randomized experiment to test how to use ICT to improve learning.Student test scores improved when ICT is integrated into the teaching programme.Both better and poorer performing students benefited when ICT is integrated.No impact is found when ICT is not integrated into the teaching programme.","explanation"

Study 1 (n = 80) documented whether classes had a library, its contents, and whether/how teachers encouraged children to use the library. Study 2 (n = 47) investigated the teachers’ confidence in teaching mathematics and the means that they used. Both studies used online surveys that were distributed via social media sites. There were four noteworthy findings. One, the Turkish preschool teachers reported viewing mathematics instruction as important to the development of children and were confident in their abilities to teach their students mathematics. However, they relied upon their general knowledge of children and their general pedagogical knowledge, rather than on their knowledge of mathematics, to do so. Two, the preschool teachers in Turkey had classroom libraries that they encouraged their students to use by having a set library time each day and by modeling how to sit and read in the library. They also encouraged family involvement in reading. However, these classroom libraries had fewer mathematics books than other types of texts.

However, they often graduate underprepared due to limited opportunities for parent interaction during their course. When engaging with parents, pre-service teachers must be able to confidently articulate their pedagogical choices, provide examples of what students will do and justify why these choices have been made. One solution lies in providing opportunities for pre-service teachers to practise parent-teacher conferencing using mixed-reality simulation technology. In this study, differentiated instruction served as the context, and reflective practice, teacher self-efficacy theory and experiential learning theory were employed as the theoretical frameworks to build on an existing parent-teacher conferencing model developed by Dotger et al. (2008) to develop a new model for use with pre-service teachers. The model uses mixed-reality simulation technology and incorporates standardised parents and students, peer observation and opportunities for feedback and reflection. The model was developed and trialled with pre-service teachers in a core unit in an initial teacher education course at an Australian university. Results indicated that the pre-service teachers felt more prepared for parent-teacher conferencing after the technology-enhanced role-play experience. Implications for practice or policy: Mixed-reality simulation technology can be a valuable tool for authentic role-play experiences for pre-service teachers when preparing for parent-teacher conferencing. Simulation technologies can provide opportunities for pre-service teachers to practise aspects of teaching, such as parent-teacher conferencing, in a safe and low-stakes environment.

To this end, various education programs have been designed to improve teachers’ and prospective teachers’ competence in CT. Such programs designing educational experiences based on teachers’ and prospective teachers’ preexisting opinions and self-efficacy perceptions about CT could achieve better results. Although the acquisition of CT skills has been suggested to start early on, these beliefs of early childhood teachers and prospective teachers have been underexplored. Therefore, this exploratory study aims to examine early childhood teachers’ and prospective teachers’ preconceptions and self-efficacy about CT. The study was conducted with 63 teachers and 78 prospective teachers in Turkey. Data were collected via an online survey in the spring of the 2020–2021 academic year. The preconceptions were assessed using a structured questionnaire, while the CT self-efficacy was measured with the Computational Thinking Scale. The findings showed similarities between teachers and prospective teachers in the preconceptions of CT. Both of them most strongly associated CT with logical thinking, problem-solving, using algorithms, coding/programming, doing mathematics, using technology in teaching, and using computers. Yet, teachers reported stronger associations between CT and logical thinking, using algorithms, and coding/programming.

Research synthesis in this area has, however, largely relied on narrative reviews to evaluate the efficacy of peer assessment. Here, we present a meta-analysis (54 studies, k = 141) of experimental and quasi-experimental studies that evaluated the effect of peer assessment on academic performance in primary, secondary, or tertiary students across subjects and domains. An overall small to medium effect of peer assessment on academic performance was found ( g = 0.31, p &lt; .001). The results suggest that peer assessment improves academic performance compared with no assessment ( g = 0.31, p = .004) and teacher assessment ( g = 0.28, p = .007), but was not significantly different in its effect from self-assessment ( g = 0.23, p = .209). Additionally, meta-regressions examined the moderating effects of several feedback and educational characteristics (e.g., online vs offline, frequency, education level). Results suggested that the effectiveness of peer assessment was remarkably robust across a wide range of contexts. These findings provide support for peer assessment as a formative practice and suggest several implications for the implementation of peer assessment into the classroom.","evaluation"

Children's screen reading comprehension, however, is underexplored. This article presents an experiment measuring the effect of reading medium on younger (10-year old) readers' comprehension, carried out in Norway in 2015. In a within-subjects design, students (n = 1139) took two comparable versions of a reading comprehension test – one on paper, and another digitally, with test version and order of medium counterbalanced. Probabilistic test theory models (two-parameter logistic (2 PL) and partial credit models) were employed for both versions of the test, allowing direct comparisons of student achievement across media. Results showed that the students in average achieved lower scores on the digital test than on the paper version. Almost a third of the students performed better on the paper test than they did on the computer test, and the negative effect of screen reading was most pronounced among high-performing girls. Scrolling and/or misplaced digital reading habits may be salient factors behind this difference, which sheds further light on children's reading performance and how this may be affected by screen technologies.

This meta-analysis investigates the overall effect size by combining the results of primary experimental studies that reveal the effect of I-VR on learning outcomes. Besides, effect sizes were calculated based on measuring moment, types of measurement, education level, the field of education, control group educational resources, and immersion type subgroups. One hundred five independent results were calculated from 48 primary studies published between 2016 and September 2020, including 39 randomized controlled trials and nine quasi-experimental studies. The sample size of primary studies includes 3179 students, 847 from K12, and 2332 from higher education. Random effects model was used in the calculation of effect size. As a result of the meta-analysis, it was determined that the overall effect size on the learning outcomes of I-VR was small ( g = 0.38). Additionally, according to the subgroup analysis results, it was revealed that I-VR significantly differentiated effect size based on educational level, the field of education, and computer-based/traditional sources. There was no significant difference in terms of the other subgroups. • The overall effect size on the learning outcomes of I-VR was small (g = 0.38). • I-VR has a significantly larger effect size in K-12 than in higher education. • I-VR yields similar results in both immediate and delayed measuring moments. • The effect of I-VR is more significant than computer-assisted compared to traditional environments. • The effect of I-VR was small for HMD and CAVE but negative and very small for MR.","evaluation"

Following the design of Pashler et al., we empirically investigated the effect of learning style preference with college-educated adults, specifically as applied to (a) verbal comprehension aptitude (listening or reading) and (b) learning based on mode of instruction (digital audiobook or e-text). First, participants’ auditory and visual learning style preferences were established based on a standardized adult learning style inventory. Participants were then given a verbal comprehension aptitude test in both oral and written forms. Results failed to show a statistically significant relationship between learning style preference (auditory, visual word) and learning aptitude (listening comprehension, reading comprehension). Second, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups that received the same instructional material from a nonfiction book, but each in a different instructional mode (digital audiobook, e-text), and then completed a written comprehension test immediately and after 2 weeks. Results demonstrated no statistically significant relationship between learning style preference (auditory, visual word) and instructional method (audiobook, e-text) for either immediate or delayed comprehension tests.

Even though many studies investigated the automated feedback in the computer-mediated learning environments, most of them focused on the multiple-choice items instead of the constructed response items. This study focuses on the latter and investigates a formative feedback system integrated into an online science curriculum module teaching climate change. The feedback system incorporates automated scoring technologies to support students' revision of scientific arguments. By analyzing the log files from the climate module, we explore how student revisions enabled by the formative feedback system correlate with student performance and learning gains. We also compare the impact of generic feedback (context-independent) vs. contextualized feedback (context-dependent). Our results showed that (1) students with higher initial scores on average were more likely to revise after the automated feedback, (2) revisions were positively related to score increases, and (3) contextualized feedback was more effective in assisting learning. The findings of this study provide insights into the use of automated feedback to improve scientific argumentation writing as part of classroom instruction.","evaluation"

However, it is unknown how feedback on multiple-tier items can improve learning success. Therefore, we assessed (1) predictors of students' perception and use of elaborated feedback, and (2) if feedback content (elaborated, verification, control) matters in explaining students' achievement in post- and retention tests. We developed computer-assisted formative tests for a teaching unit on evolutionary adaptations. Three treatment groups were employed with varying feedback content: Treatment 1 (T1) was an elaborated instruction-based feedback, T2 was a dichotomous verification feedback, and T3 (control) consisted of reading appropriate texts (no formative assessment and no feedback). Afterwards, T1 was separated into one subgroup with pupils who used the feedback thoroughly (T1A) and a subgroup that did not use the feedback (T1B). Ten secondary classrooms were used and 261 pupils participated in this study. Each student in each classroom was randomly assigned to one treatment group. Correlation and univariate regression analysis showed that perception and use of elaborated feedback were related to intrinsic motivation and self-reported grades. Multivariate analysis of covariance was applied to check treatment effects on post-tests and retention tests as dependent variables. Results revealed that verification feedback (T2) and elaborated feedback when students did use it (T1A) was superior to no feedback (T3) and elaborated feedback when students did not use it (T1B). Implications for the design of multiple-tier diagnostic assessments are discussed. Computer-assisted multiple-tier tests allow for diagnosis of conceptual learning.Feedback effects were assessed with a randomized control trial.Use of elaborated feedback depends on intrinsic motivation and cognitive ability.Verification feedback is more effective as elaborated feedback.Elaborated feedback is effective when it is perceived as helpful.","evaluation"

This study also aimed to investigate the differences in learning outcomes between retention and transfer questions. The independent variables for the study were gender and type of multimedia resources (static versus animated), and the covariate was spatial ability. The dependent variables for the first study goal were learning outcomes measured by performance scores in two procedural learning tasks (functioning of a toilet cistern and a car brake system). The dependent variables for the second study goal were learning outcomes measured by retention and transfer performance scores in the two procedural learning tasks. A total of 245 undergraduate students completed participation online. As anticipated, spatial ability had the most significant overall influence on learning outcomes. Gender differences were also found, even after controlling for spatial ability. The study, however, failed to identify effects of multimedia type in learning outcomes. Male participants consistently outperformed female participants in all learning tasks, regardless of the multimedia type. While the scores from the transfer questions were lower than the scores from retention questions, as expected, this decline was significantly less for males in the car brakes task. This was not the case in the toilet cistern task however, implying a potential subject domain effect. Overall, this study is significant in that it offers empirical evidence of gender effects, separate from spatial ability, when learning with multimedia resources.","evaluation"

Music participation was related to higher scores on all 4 subjects and these relationships were stronger for instrumental music than vocal music (Cohen’s d range: .28 to .44 [small-medium effect sizes] and .05 to .13 [null-small effect sizes]). School music achievement positively related to scores on all subjects; such relationships were stronger for achievement in instrumental music compared with vocal music. Higher levels of music engagement (number of courses) was related to higher exam scores on all subjects; this pattern was more pronounced for very high engagement in instrumental music (d range: .37 to .55; medium effect sizes) compared with vocal music (d range: .11 to .26; small effect sizes). The effect sizes of these group differences are greater than the effect sizes corresponding to average annual gains of students’ academic achievement during high school—in other words, highly engaged instrumental music students were, on average, academically over 1 year ahead of their peers. The findings suggest that multiyear engagement in music, especially instrumental music, may benefit high school academic achievement.

In the explicit learning condition, learners received explicit instruction about the target lexical items before reading (EIG). In the intentional condition, learners were instructed to check the multimedia glosses while reading the texts (+IG) whereas in the incidental condition, they did not receive such instruction (-IG). Reading comprehension was measured through multiple-choice and written recall tests and vocabulary acquisition was measured through the vocabulary knowledge scale (VKS) and word recognition test (WRT). The results indicated that there were vocabulary gains for all the groups regardless of the learning conditions. While the EIG and +IG achieved a similar VKS performance, the EIG made greater gains of target vocabulary in the WRT. In addition, EIG was the only condition to maintain a long-term knowledge of the learned words. For reading comprehension, results varied according to the tests, with the +IG faring better in multiple-choice test and EIG achieving a higher written recall.","evaluation"

Our general goal is to assess the role of peer graded assignments in such courses and how they contribute to students’ learning and motivation. In order to achieve this broad goal we look at the peer grading process from multiple perspectives. We present an analysis of demographics for peer grading participants and show how they are different from the general course population. We also look at different aspects of peer grading assignments such as lengths of essays, time spent grading, number of gradings performed, final grades and percentage of relevant videos watched. We compare these distributions for different assignments and also their correlations on a level of individual learners. We show that participation in the first peer graded assignment is the best predictor of completion for the course as a whole. Moreover, learners who did well on the first peer graded assignment show better engagement and do better in the course overall. Finally, we report on validity and reliability of peer graders as compared to instructor graders and trained undergraduate graders.","evaluation"

First, it examined anonymity's effects on the distributions of affective, cognitive, and meta-cognitive peer feedback. Second, it looked at the effects of anonymity on learners' perceived learning, their perceptions of whether peer assessment was fair, and their attitudes toward the system. The study's two-group experimental design randomly assigned 32 pre-service teachers either to an identifiable condition (with the assessors' full real names attached), or an anonymous condition; and both groups were asked to provide written comments on five assessees' microteaching performance based on videos of their teaching. The results indicated that the anonymous group provided significantly more cognitive feedback (i.e., vague suggestions, the extension type of explicit suggestions for improvement), whereas the identifiable group offered more affective feedback (i.e., supporting, opposing) and more metacogntive feedback (i.e., reflective comments). The anonymous group also perceived that they had learned more from peer assessment and had more positive attitudes toward the system, but they also perceived peer comments as being less fair than the identifiable group did. The findings provide important evidence for the cognitive and pedagogical benefits of anonymity in online peer assessment among pre-service teachers. The study examined the role of anonymity in online peer assessment.Anonymity increased cognitive comments, but reduced affective comments.A higher level of perceived learning was observed in the anonymous group.The anonymous group had more positive attitude toward the system.The anonymous group had a lower level of perception that peer assessment was fair.","evaluation"

Enhancing students’ argumentative peer learning processes and outcomes","2021-03-01","This study compared the effects of support for peer feedback, peer feedforward and their combination on students’ peer learning processes, argumentative essay quality and domain-specific learning. Participants were 86 BSc students who were randomly divided over 43 dyads. These dyads, in a two-factorial experimental design, were assigned to four conditions including: peer feedback (n = 22), peer feedforward (n = 22), mixed (n = 20) and control group (n = 22) conditions. An online peer feedback environment named EduTech was designed which allowed us to implement various types of support in the form of question prompts. In this online environment, students were asked to write an argumentative essay on a controversial topic, to engage in peer learning processes and to revise their essay. Overall, the results showed that students in the three experimental conditions (peer feedback, peer feedforward and their combination) benefited more than students in the control group condition (without any support) in term of peer learning processes, argumentative essay quality and domain-specific learning. However, there was no significant difference among the three experimental conditions. This implies that peer feedforward can be as important as peer feedback in collaborative learning environments which is often neglected both in theory and practice. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic? Writing argumentative essays is a common practice for higher education students in various disciplines which deal with controversial issues. Writing argumentative essay requires solid argumentation strategies which makes it a challenging task for higher education students. Additional instructional support is needed to help students write high-quality argumentative essays. What this paper adds? Peer learning is a promising instructional strategy for improving students’ argumentative essay writing and learning. Online support in the form of question prompts to guide students during peer learning can improve their argumentative essay writing and learning. Next to the peer feedback, peer feedforward is also a promising instructional approach to support students’ argumentative essay writing and learning. Implications for practice and/or policy Given the positive effects of peer learning processes, the use of peer feedback and peer feedforward should be given more attention by teachers to support students write high-quality argumentative essays for controversial issues. Teachers and educational designers should not only provide opportunities for students to engage in peer feedback processes (how I am doing?) but also in peer feedforward processes (where to next?).","evaluation"

Using a randomized field experiment among 633 physics students in six schools in Dutch secondary education, we study assessments with the polling technology Socrative , by dividing students into three groups. Students in the cooperative group use a combination of peer discussions and teacher feedback, while students in the individual group use teacher feedback. To compare differences in metacognitive skills, students in the control group only use Socrative , but do not receive formative feedback from either teacher or peers. The results show that there is a significant positive effect of the cooperative treatment on both metacognitive skills and motivation in comparison with the control group. We find that students with low metacognitive skills benefit significantly more from the cooperative treatment than students with high metacognitive skills. No effects are found for the individual treatment. However, girls significantly increase their metacognitive skills and are more motivated than boys, when using an individual treatment. Additionally, a mediation analysis shows that motivation partially mediates the cooperative treatment and metacognitive skills. Based on these results, we recommend a combination of peer discussions and teacher feedback in physics courses. • A cooperative treatment is effective in improving metacognition. • A cooperative treatment is effective for students with low metacognitive skills. • Girls improve their metacognitive skills and motivation in an individual treatment.","evaluation"

E-books must be designed to facilitate students' learning effects. We designed two versions (high/low interactive) of the electronic picture book titled Color Monster's Adventure, which has a fantasy storyline and appealing art design, and embedded basic concepts of chromatology and color psychology. The low interactive e-book version contains only simple interactive buttons with narration, and the high interactive e-book version features the following three advanced functions: guidance, prompt and feedback. We conducted an experiment in a northern Taiwan elementary school with a total of 40 fourth-grade students. The results showed that the students in the high interaction group performed significantly better in reading motivation, story comprehension and chromatics concepts than their low interaction counterparts. We concluded by proposing a high interactive e-book model and providing suggestions regarding integrating proper scaffolding into designing the e-book content to improve students' reading performance. Display Omitted Emphasis on interactive features in E-books can facilitate student learning.Interactive storybooks improve motivation, comprehension, and chromatic concepts.Interactive features should be congruent with story and based on instructional design principles.Effective functions of interactive books include guidance, prompting, and feedback.Teachers could use the identified high interactive functions in reading activities.","evaluation"

Positive reactivity, or the memory improvement found when JOLs are provided, is typically observed on related pairs, while no reactivity is commonly found on unrelated pairs. In four experiments, we examined JOL reactivity effects by comparing JOL and no-JOL groups to other groups who engaged in relational-type encoding/judgment tasks. Experiment 1 replicated positive JOL reactivity effects with related pairs with an extension to symmetrically related pairs. Next, Experiment 2 found that providing judgments of associative memory-a task that does not involve memory predictions-yielded equivalent reactivity patterns as JOLs. Experiment 3 replicated this reactivity pattern using a frequency of co-occurrence judgment task. Finally, In Experiment 4, a similar positive reactivity pattern was found using a relational encoding task when compared to a standard JOL. Collectively, our results suggest that previous JOL reactivity patterns are not solely due to memory forecasting processes via JOLs and likely reflect relational encoding that is strategically applied towards related, but not unrelated pairs.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11409-022-09301-2.","evaluation"

The use of technological tools involving theoretically-grounded instructional scaffolds can be one promising solution to support these activities. Accordingly, this mixed methods research utilized scaffolds in an online environment that can activate self-regulated and co-regulated learning during FPA and investigated their impact on peer feedback provision and uptake. It included 70 ninth-grade students assigned into two groups to perform FPA activities for two writing tasks either with online regulation scaffolds (ORS) or without them. Using a new online FPA environment developed by the authors, they composed a story and poem in the first and second writing tasks, respectively. Results regarding peer feedback provision revealed that feedback in the group using ORS was briefer in two writing tasks, but it had significantly higher quality in the first writing task. In terms of feedback uptake, ORS led to more likelihood of reading peer feedback in the first writing task, but the percentage of students revising their performance was similar independent of ORS. Students’ experiences highlighted the role of feedback requests and goal setting and planning. Besides ORS, qualitative results called attention to the influence of task, learner, and feedback characteristics. Overall, this study concludes that ORS can be beneficial for improving peer feedback provision and uptake, especially in the first FPA practices for complex performance tasks. Moreover, it contributes to the development of the FPA model and guides the instructional design of online FPA environments with empirical evidence. • Online regulation scaffolds (ORS) were designed for peer assessment of writings. • ORS promoted peer feedback quality and reading peer feedback in the first writing. • Students emphasized the role of feedback requests and goal setting and planning. • Feedback use and task, learner, and feedback characteristics need more attention. • An assessment model for regulated learning was modified to remark task conditions.","evaluation"

However, the high attrition rates in MOOCs have often been cited as a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Traditional educational approaches are usually unable to identify such large-scale number of at-risk students in danger of dropping out in time to support effective intervention design. While building dropout prediction models using learning analytics are promising in informing intervention design for these at-risk students, results of the current prediction model construction methods do not enable personalized intervention for these students. In this study, we take an initial step to optimize the dropout prediction model performance toward intervention personalization for at-risk students in MOOCs. Specifically, based on a temporal prediction mechanism, this study proposes to use the deep learning algorithm to construct the dropout prediction model and further produce the predicted individual student dropout probability. By taking advantage of the power of deep learning, this approach not only constructs more accurate dropout prediction models compared with baseline algorithms but also comes up with an approach to personalize and prioritize intervention for at-risk students in MOOCs through using individual drop out probabilities. The findings from this study and implications are then discussed.","evolution"

In this study, context-aware recommender systems perceive the user’s location, time, and company. The context-based recommender system retrieves patterns from World Wide Web-based on the user’s past interactions and provides future news recommendations. We have presented different techniques to support media recommendations for smartphones, to create a framework for context-aware, to filter E-learning content, and to deliver convenient news to the user. To achieve this goal, we have used content-based, collaborative filtering, a hybrid recommender system, and implemented a Web ontology language (OWL). We have also used the Resource Description Framework (RDF), JAVA, machine learning, semantic mapping rules, and natural ontology languages that suggest user items related to the search. In our work, we have used E-paper to provide users with the required news. After applying the semantic reasoning approach, we have concluded that by some means, this approach works similarly as a content-based recommender system since by taking the gain of a semantic approach, we can also recommend items according to the user’s interests.

Therefore, we define student performance as obtaining personal learning objective(s). This study examines a subsample of students in a graduate-level blended MOOC who shared on-campus course completion as a learning objective. Aggregated activity frequencies, specific course item frequencies, and order of activities were analysed to predict student performance using correlations, multiple regressions, and process mining. All aggregated MOOC activity frequencies related positively to on-campus exam grade. However, this relation is less clear when controlling for past performance. In total, 65% of the specific course items showed significant correlations with final exam grade. Students who passed the course spread their learning over more days compared with students who failed.

Then, an attribute reduction algorithm based on improved Bayesian fuzzy rough set was adopted for attribute reduction, and the behavior indexes that are closely related to the autonomous learning effect of learners were selected for correlation analysis. After that, this paper proposed a method for detecting non-autonomous learning behavior based on multiple time scales, combining short-term autonomous learning pattern with long-term autonomous learning behavior and resource access behavior, this paper also analyzed the typical autonomous learning pattern of learners through the learning of hidden layer features. At last, experimental results proved the effectiveness of the proposed analysis method.","evolution"

As LMS design shifts from technology-centric to user-centric, developers need to prioritize user experience (UX) to improve their LMS. LMS as part of an e-learning system can benefit from UX research to measure ease of use and user satisfaction. Many academic institutions around the world prefer to use their own customized LMS, such as: B. Moodle is an open source LMS platform built and maintained by most Jordanian universities. Therefore, UX evaluation and measurement is very important for LMS. Several studies have been conducted to analyze and measure LMS products for user feedback. On the other hand, these studies only partially consider LMS products. Instead of observing the quality of LMS, they conducted a study focused on comparing LMS and gaining awareness. The purpose of this study is to collect comments and feedback and evaluate the UX when dealing with LMS. Using Moodle as a case study, this study evaluates the user experience of LMS. Data were collected from 867 participants from various Jordanian institutions using LMS. An online survey was prepared and distributed through various social media groups. This study proposes to use the UX Survey Tool (UEQ) to evaluate and quantify the user experience of LMS. This study aims to get feedback and evaluate and identify the UX while interacting with the LMS. In general, implementing a user experience questionnaire to evaluate and evaluate an LMS provides not only complete user awareness, but also the relative quality level of the LMS. The results provide feedback and support assistance in the implementation of the LMS.","evolution"

The current data-driven education system provides many opportunities to utilize the enormous amount of collected data about students' activities and performance for personalized education, adapting teaching methods, and decision making. On the other hand, such benefits come at a cost to privacy. For example, the identification of a student's poor performance across multiple courses. While several works have been conducted on quantifying the re-identification risks of individuals in released datasets, they assume an adversary's prior knowledge about target individuals. Most of them do not utilize all the available information in the datasets. For example, event-level information that associates multiple records to the same individual and correlation between attributes. In this work, we propose a method using a Markov Model (MM) to quantify re-identification risks using all available information in the data under a more realistic threat model that assumes different levels of an adversary's knowledge about the target individual, ranging from any one of the attributes to all given attributes. Moreover, we propose a workflow for efficiently calculating MM risk which is highly scalable to large number of attributes. Experimental results from real education datasets show the efficacy of our model for re-identification risk. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? There has been a number of works/research conducted on privacy risk quantification in datasets and in the Web. Majority of them have strong assumption about adversary's prior knowledge of target individual(s). Most of them do not utilize all the available information in the datasets, eg, event-level or duplicate records and correlation between attributes. What this paper adds? This paper proposes a new re-identification risk quantification model using Markov models. Our model addresses the shortcomings of existing works, eg, strong assumption about adversary's knowledge, unexplainable model, and utilizing available information in the datasets. Specifically, our proposed model not only focuses on the uniqueness of data points in the datasets (as most of the other existing methods), but also takes into account uniformity and correlation characteristics of these data points. Re-identification risk quantification is computationally expensive and is not scalable to large datasets with increasing number of attributes. This paper introduces a workflow for data custodians to use to efficiently evaluate the worst-case re-identification risk in their datasets before releasing. It presents extensive experimental evaluation results of the proposed model for quantifying re-identification risks on several real education datasets. Implications for practice and/or policy? Empirical results on real education datasets validate the significance and efficacy of the proposed model for re-identification risk quantification compared to existing approaches. Our model can be used by the data custodians as a tool to evaluate the worst-case risk of a dataset. It empowers data custodians to make informed decisions on appropriate actions to mitigate these risks (eg, data perturbation) before sharing or releasing their datasets to third parties. A typical use case would be one where the data custodians is an online course/program provider, which collects data about students' engagement with their courses and would like to share it with third parties for them to run learning analytics that would provide value-added benefits back to the data custodian. We specifically study the privacy risk quantification for education data; however, our model is applicable to any tabular data release.","evolution"

The proposed system collects learners’ brainwaves using a portable Electroencephalogram and processes them via a supervised machine learning algorithm, named K-nearest neighbours (KNN), to recognise real-time emotional status. Besides, it uses a reinforcement learning approach to analyse the learners’ emotional states and automatically recommend the best-fitted content that keeps the students in a positive mood. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in two forms: 1) the system performance and 2) student engagement, satisfaction, and learning. A convenience sampling method is used to select 30 students from the pollution of 281 PartII-undergraduate students who study computer science during the 2020-21 academic year at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China. The selected students are divided into homogenous control and experimental groups for learning English listening and reading skills. According to the machine learning results, the trained KNN recognises the emotional states with an accuracy of 74.3%, the precision of 70.8%, and recall of 69.3%. In addition, the results of the t-Test demonstrate that the proposed e-learning system model has no significant impact on learners’ learning and engagement but enhances the student’s satisfaction compared to traditional e-learning systems (p < 0.05).","evolution"
